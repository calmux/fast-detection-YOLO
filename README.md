# fast-detection-YOLO

A real-time object detection app based on lightDenseYOLO. The lightDenseYOLO implementation leverages lightDenseNet as its feature extractor and YOLO v2 as the core detection module.

Fast-detection-YOLO was trained on two renowned object detection datasets (MS COCO and Pascal VOC 07+12).
